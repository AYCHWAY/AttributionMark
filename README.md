# OpenStreetMap Attribution Mark

## Introduction

OSM thrives on users being aware of the fact that the underlying OSM data of whichever map they're viewing can be edited. Find a problem on the map? Fix it! This only works if there's awareness that the map can be edited.

At the same time we do a fairly poor job in driving users from any given OSM based map to OpenStreetMap.org.  The ever-expanding range of OSM based maps are an incredible communication channel to win individuals as potential contributors or support the OSM project in other ways.

This proposal suggests two things: first, attributing OSM data with a visually more prominent and appealing **Attribition Mark** instead of the plain text "© OpenStreetMap contributors" and second, an updated `http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright` page that better explains OpenStreetMap and has the optional ability to mention and link map providers.

Inspired by successful campaigns like Fair Trade or Intel Inside, this proposal is an initiative to build more awareness around what's inside the map, why this matters and ultimately help grow OpenStreetMap. 

## Goals

* Drive more potential contributors and supporters to OSM
* Create more awareness around OSM being open and editable
* Create a way to reflect the map provider on the copyright page

## Proposal

1. Use a visual mark to attribute OpenStreetMap data instead of "© OpenStreetMap contributors", link to http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
2. Improve http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright so that it (a) explains OpenStreetMap better, (b) optionally allows for linking to the actual provider of the map
